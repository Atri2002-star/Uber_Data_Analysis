# Uber_Data_Analysis
Uber ride data analysis using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to explore user behavior, trends, and booking patterns.

This project focuses on analyzing Uber ride data using Python, with the help of Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization. Key questions addressed include ride category preferences, booking purposes, peak booking times, low-demand months, popular days of the week, and typical ride distances. Insights such as increased bookings on Fridays and Sundays, and peak activity during January, November, and December are highlighted. The analysis aids in understanding user behavior and improving service strategy. This project is ideal for practicing real-world data analysis, data cleaning, and exploratory data visualization using Python.
